Heat Load helps users track sauna and steam room sessions from Apple Watch, including duration, heart rate, and optional cold shower logging.

1. Information We Collect
Heat Load may process the following information:

Session details you create:
Heat activity type (Sauna or Steam Room)
Session duration and timer preset
Optional cold shower selection
Health data (if permission is granted):
Heart rate during active tracked sessions
Workout/session records written to Apple Health
2. How We Use Information
We use information only to provide core app functionality, including:

Running and saving heat session timers
Displaying heart-rate metrics in-session
Writing eligible workout/session information to Apple Health
Syncing session and trial/unlock state between Apple Watch and iPhone for your own use
Enabling app purchase/unlock status
3. Health Data and Apple Health
If you grant Health permissions, Heat Load reads and/or writes data through Apple HealthKit solely to support session tracking features.

Health data is used only for app functionality you request.
We do not sell Health data.
We do not use Health data for advertising.
You can revoke Health permissions at any time in the Health app and iOS/watchOS settings.

4. Data Storage
Heat Load stores data primarily on your device(s).
Some session and app-state information may sync between your paired iPhone and Apple Watch using Apple’s device connectivity frameworks.

We do not operate our own cloud backend for personal data storage at this time.

5. Purchases
Heat Load offers a free trial and an in-app purchase to unlock unlimited use.
Purchase processing is handled by Apple via the App Store and StoreKit.

We do not receive your full payment card details.

We do not share your personal data with third parties for targeted advertising.

Data may be processed by Apple services required to run the app (e.g., HealthKit, StoreKit, Watch/iPhone connectivity).

Deleting sessions within the app (if supported)
Removing app permissions
Uninstalling the app and deleting associated data
Managing Apple Health records in the Health app
